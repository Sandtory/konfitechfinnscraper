## Finn.no Job Scraper

A TypeScript scraper built with [Crawlee](https://crawlee.dev/) to extract job details from Finn.no using [Cheerio](https://cheerio.js.org/) wrapped into [CheerioCrawler](https://crawlee.dev/api/cheerio-crawler/class/CheerioCrawler).

## Features

- Scrapes job listings from Finn.no based on a search URL
- Extracts comprehensive job details including:
  - Job title
  - Job description
  - Company information
  - Contact details
  - Application URL
  - Location
  - Employment type
  - Salary (if available)
  - Publication date
- Handles pagination to process all search results
- Respects the maximum number of jobs to scrape
- Robust error handling for missing data or website changes
- Optimized for efficiency with concurrent requests

## Input Configuration

The scraper accepts the following inputs:

- `searchUrl` (required): The Finn.no job search URL to start scraping from. 
  - Example: `https://www.finn.no/job/fulltime/search.html?occupation=0.23&occupation=0.22`
  - Default: `https://www.finn.no/job/fulltime/search.html?occupation=0.23&occupation=0.22`
  
- `maxJobs` (optional): Maximum number of jobs to scrape.
  - Default: `100`
  - Minimum: `1`
  - Maximum: `1000`

## Output Data Structure

The scraper outputs an array of job objects with the following structure:

```json
{
  "url": "https://www.finn.no/job/fulltime/ad.html?finnkode=123456789",
  "title": "Software Developer",
  "description": "Full job description text...",
  "company": "Example Company AS",
  "contactPerson": "John Doe",
  "phoneNumber": "123 45 678",
  "email": "contact@example.com",
  "applicationUrl": "https://example.com/apply",
  "location": "Oslo",
  "employmentType": "Heltid",
  "salary": "600 000 - 800 000 per år",
  "publicationDate": "Snarest"
}
```

## How it works

1. The scraper starts at the provided search URL
2. It extracts all job listing URLs from the search results page
3. It visits each job listing URL and extracts the job details
4. It handles pagination to process all search results
5. It respects the maximum number of jobs to scrape
6. The scraped data is stored in the default dataset

## Getting started
